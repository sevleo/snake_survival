Add enemy snake
    Enemy snake appears at a random location at the start of the game (when you begin the movement)
        - Later make snake come from beyond the border of the playfield

    Enemy snake executes the random walk

    Enemy snake does not require food to grow, it grows automatically. If it encounters food, it will make the player's snake shorter.
    If enemy snake touches the player's snake, it will die, but it will make the player's snake shorter by the length of the deceased enemy snake.
    If the player's snake touches an enemy snake, half the size of the player's snake will be transferred to the enemy snake.
